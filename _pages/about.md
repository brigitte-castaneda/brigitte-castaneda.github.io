I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Universidad de los Andes (Bogota, Colombia) under the guidance of [Hernando Zuleta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CgFQtFIAAAAJ&hl=en). Currently, I am part of the first cohort of graduate students in the Carbon Market Mentoring Program created as part of the Supporting Readiness for Article 6 Cooperation ([SPAR6C](https://www.spar6c.org/blog/meet-students-newly-created-mentorship-programme-carbon-markets)) program, co-led by the [GGGI](https://gggi.org/country/colombia/) and the [UNEP](https://unepccc.org/).

My research interests involve macroeconomics and environmental economics. My research aims to provide helpful recommendations for Carbon Markets and Just Transition policies.

The first article in my thesis examines _the effect of carbon taxes on economic growth and employment_, emphasizing the role of the energy mix. In the second chapter, I analyze _structural change and energy efficiency in Latin American countries_, as well as the impact of carbon pricing policies on these variables. The final chapter sheds light on the fiscal resources curse, revealing that the reliance on these resources extends beyond the producing municipalities in Colombia and throughout the entire national territory.

Previously I worked as a consultant for the [CFS](https://cfs.uniandes.edu.co/es/), the [CREE](https://creenergia.org/) and WorldBank.
