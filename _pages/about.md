I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Universidad de los Andes (Bogota, Colombia) under the guidance of [Hernando Zuleta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CgFQtFIAAAAJ&hl=en). I currently work as a consultant for the [CFS](https://cfs.uniandes.edu.co/es/) at the Universidad de los Andes and the [CREE](https://creenergia.org/).

My research interests involve macroeconomics and environmental economics. My research aims to provide helpful recommendations for carbon pricing and just energy transition policies.

The first article in my thesis examines _the effect of carbon taxes on economic growth and employment_, emphasizing the role of the energy mix. In the second chapter, I analyze _structural change and energy efficiency in Latin American countries, as well as the impact of carbon pricing policies on these variables. 

The final chapter of my thesis is part of a mentoring program with [GGGI](https://gggi.org/colombia-takes-significant-steps-towards-climate-action-with-the-launch-of-the-spar6c-program/); the study examines _how students' preferences for green jobs change in communities where oil fields have been closed_.
