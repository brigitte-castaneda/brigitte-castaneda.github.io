I received my MSc (with Distinction) in *Statistical Learning Theory* from [Skoltech](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/education/msc-programs/ds/slt/) and [Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/ma/sltheory/), supervised by [Maxim Panov](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=BqDhGJQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I worked on unsupervised graph embedding as member of the [Structural Learning Group](http://strlearn.ru/).

My research interests currently lie within Representation Learning, Statistical learning theory, Generative Models and Reinforcement Learning. My updated CV is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IHbSs6S5tZ2wG65jmnWlmUF-aCnXPC2V/view?usp=sharing).
