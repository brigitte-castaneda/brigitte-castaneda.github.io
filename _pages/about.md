I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Universidad de los Andes (Bogota, Colombia) under the guidance of [Hernando Zuleta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CgFQtFIAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests involve macroeconomics and environmental economics. My research explores the impact of carbon taxes on economic growth and employment. The first article in my thesis examines the effect of carbon taxes on economic growth and employment, emphasizing the role of the energy mix. In the second chapter, I analyze structural change and energy efficiency in Latin American countries since 1990, as well as the impact of carbon pricing policies on these variables. The final chapter of my thesis is part of a mentoring program with [GGGI](https://gggi.org/colombia-takes-significant-steps-towards-climate-action-with-the-launch-of-the-spar6c-program/); the study examines how students' preferences for green jobs change in communities where oil fields have been closed. Overall my research aims to provide helpful recommendations for carbon pricing and just energy transition policies.

I currently work as a consultant for the [CFS](https://cfs.uniandes.edu.co/es/) at the Universidad de los Andes and the [CREE](https://creenergia.org/). I also work on a joint project with [MCC](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/index.html) to determine whether recycling revenue can make fossil fuel subsidy reform acceptable. This project is funded by [EfD](https://www.efdinitiative.org/research/projects/acceptability-surveys) and involves a survey experiment in Colombia.
