I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Universidad de los Andes (Bogota, Colombia). My advisor is [Hernando Zuleta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CgFQtFIAAAAJ&hl=en). Currently, I'm in a summer internship on an inclusive - just transition at [Environmental Defense Fund](https://www.edf.org/).

My primary research fields are Macroeconomics and Environmental economics. My research focuses on the evaluation of the impact of carbon taxes on economic growth and employment. The first paper of my thesis explores the effect of the carbon tax on economic growth and jobs, with an emphasis on the role of the energy mix. The second chapter of my thesis endeavors to answer Hhow effectively are workers making the transition to greener jobs in developing countries? My research aims to formulate policy recommendations to ensure a just transition.
