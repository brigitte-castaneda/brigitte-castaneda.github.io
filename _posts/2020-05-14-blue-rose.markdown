Lost, in my deepest dream I found  
a cold place far from false mirrors,  
where the safe road of absent hope  
would not let me feel around. 
{: style="color:black; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;"} 
The moonlight reflected on the snow,  
and there my eyes were captured by  
a delicate flower in the distance,  
as it was trembling all alone.  
{: style="color:black; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;"} 
That was the rose I chose
{: style="color:black; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;"} 
Its fragile beauty stole my thoughts,  
its deep sea blue stabbed my senses,  
its wild innocence was hidden from  
a twist of fate against all odds  
{: style="color:black; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;"} 
I confused tiny drops on its blue petals  
with tears from other seasons,  
and approached despite the fear  
of turning big smiles into letters.  
{: style="color:black; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;"} 
That was the rose I chose
{: style="color:black; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;"} 
Imagination seemed to be the best haven,  
from fields of gold to shallow valleys,  
sunsets that felt secure and warm,  
adventures begging to be taken.  
{: style="color:black; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;"} 
Even when wind could not reach my rose,  
that gelid night had to play its role.  
I watched it die so close to my soul;  
as quickly as it appeared, it froze.  
{: style="color:black; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;"} 
That was the rose I chose
{: style="color:black; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;"} 
My shaking hands refused to set it free.  
Not even the only star left on the sky  
could restore its endless bloom.  
The sudden rising sun betrayed my will.  
{: style="color:black; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;"} 
Silent past whispered me lies I’d never heard.  
There is one I couldn’t afford to ignore.  
How could I live knowing I am not allowed  
to wake up from the dream we never shared?  
{: style="color:black; font-size: 100%; text-align: center;"} 

And that was the rose I lost.
