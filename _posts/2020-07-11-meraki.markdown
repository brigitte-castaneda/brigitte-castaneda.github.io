Truth be told, the idea of composing a song from scratch in a month still resonates as crazy to me. Nobody warns you how challenging it could be. Yet I enjoyed every single part of it. Despite I did not know where it was heading most of times, suddenly pieces started to fit and inspiration played its role: it started to sound like a song.

Just as Dante was kindly guided through the circles of Hell by Virgil, I should deeply thank [Eliza Carrington](https://www.instagram.com/eliza.carrington/) for her guitar/composition lessons and songwriting advices, which made possible this crazy song idea I had. It worths mentioning, she happens to be an [amazing singer, songwriter and guitarist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCslUnS2O1EMLiJPeRDXksMQ) and I feel lucky to learn from her experience and perspective.

#### What did I learn?
{: .text-justify}
- Do not understimate the power of secondary dominants. 
- The balance between tension and resolution is key.
- Explore imagery and metaphors in conveying emotional lyrics.
- Adding a sad piano, choir, or odd drums could lead to interesting ideas.
- Avoiding predictability by incorporating variations and arrangements.
- Enjoying the process itself is the best reward.

I need to apologize to all my close friends who were almost emotionally forced to listen to my endless song drafts and providing me valuable feedback. You are the best!

Hopefully this is only the start :)
