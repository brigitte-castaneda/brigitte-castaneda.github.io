Competitive Programming has always been one of my passions, although not a reciprocating one. It was around 2010 when I first heard about it at my university. What started as an authentic journey towards constant Rejected or TLE, turned into a remarkable opportunity to make great friendships and improve my problem-solving skills, which in retrospect shaped most of my later choices in life.

One of my New Year's resolutions, perhaps influenced by extended conversations with an outstanding programmer and food addict, was to improve my competitive programming skills by investing a considerable amount of time studying algorithms from a theoretical and practical point of view.  Consequently, as a metric of improvement, I considered no other than the renowned Russian competitive programming platform [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).  My ambitious hope: to become purple ranked (>1900 ELO). Only time will tell, yet I will use this [repository](https://github.com/Alfo5123/CodeTrain) to track my progress.
