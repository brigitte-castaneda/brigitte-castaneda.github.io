Altough it is evident that the opponent had made a mistake at an early stage of the game, I felt the immense pressure to not make any blunders and simplify the position as much as possible so that the advantage was definitive. Surprinsingly, according to some engines, I work remarkably better under pressure: no inaccuracies nor mistakes by my side :)
