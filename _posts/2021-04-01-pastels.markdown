Life knows how to push the right buttons. There I was, triggered by the unreasonable will to try new things, once again. After buying a few basic books on drawing and watching some tutorials, I was already excited to start without a clear purpose but to explore my creativity. Let me share some of the experiments so far. 

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two first" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pastel_2.jpeg">
    <img class="col one last" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pastel_1.jpeg">
</div>

<div class="col three caption">
    Clearly, there is tons of room for improvement. 
</div>

I should admit this medium offers interesting possibilities of blending colors, by adding different values in layers and provide vivid tonalities and texture to the drawing. I will be dedicating some free time to learn the painting and drawing techniques. I am afraid it's a long journey indeed. Yet again, art finds its way to put life to a halt.
