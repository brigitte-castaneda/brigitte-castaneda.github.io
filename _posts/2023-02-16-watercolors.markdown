I am not sure whether it was the multiple IG accounts I followed on the topic, or a few paintings that moved me just by using a few translucent strokes, yet I was cautivated by this art form for a while. Deciding to do something more than faulty geometric shapes, I started taking online lessons early this year. Here are some of the results. This could easily be an attempt to monitor my progress over time and hopefully motivated others to try it out.

Thanks to Anna Obratzsova for my first watercolor palette set as present :)
