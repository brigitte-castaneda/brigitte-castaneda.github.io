This study aims to determine <i>whether the economic effect of introducing a carbon tax differs between countries, according to the energy mix<i> of clean and polluting inputs. Following a model of directed technical change and environmental, I empirically analyze the implementation of a carbon tax in countries with different carbon-intensity energy sources and the allocation of revenues. I find four main results: (i) In the absence of subsidies, carbon taxes have a negative effect on economic growth, (ii) this negative effect is a decreasing function of the proportion of clean energy sources in the energy mix increases. (iii) subsidies for clean inputs have a positive effect on economic growth, and (iv) the magnitude of this effect grows with the proportion of clean energy sources. These results are consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model and suggest that policymakers could consider this relationship between the energy mix and the economic effect of a carbon tax when creating environmental regulations.

The main findings provide empirical evidence on the relationship between carbon tax implementation and economic growth, highlighting the importance of considering the composition of energy sources in the analysis.

#### Lessons learned
<ul>
    <li>Implementing a carbon tax is associated with an increase in the GDP growth rate in the early years of the climate policy.</li>
    <li>The effect of the carbon tax on GDP growth varies depending on the composition of the energy matrix. In countries with a high share of carbon-intensive energy sources, the carbon tax is associated with a reduction in the growth rate. In countries with a high share of clean energy sources, the carbon tax is associated with an increase in the growth rate.</li>
    <li>The magnitude of the effect of the carbon tax on GDP growth varies depending on the model specification used. The estimated effects range from 0.6 to 1.5 percentage points in the year after implementing the policy.</li>
    <li>The effect of the carbon tax on employment rate is not statistically significant in the first three years after the policy.</li>
</ul>
